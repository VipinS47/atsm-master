	* TestNN.java: Correct a copy-paste error in the application's
	name.

2006-02-18 11:11  mokhov

	* ChangeLog, Makefile: Add ChangeLogs to all the apps. Add makefile
	rule change-log to generate with less effort. Add TOOLSDIR variable
	as it the directory now referenced more than once. Make sure the
	ChangeLog is added to both -bin and -src distros.

2006-02-13 01:29  mokhov

	* Makefile: Implement automatic .tex usage generation by all the
	apps for future inclusion into the manual automatically. Adjust
	Makefiles and correct some minor usage info.

2006-01-27 14:52  mokhov

	* TestNN.java: Adjust usage information to be more correct and add
	missing options in it. Cosmetic review for spacing.

2006-01-21 23:46  mokhov

	* Makefile, README, TestNN.java: Prepare TestNN for preliminary
	release. Clean up the application from the dead code and test only
	NeuralNetwork by itself by simulating epoch training as
	NeuralNetwor.train() does except avoiding looking for and using a
	corresponding training set cluster. Add option processing with
	OptionProcessor and a few standard and old options passed through
	it. Add application versioning, usage(), and version checks. Dump
	the output .xml files to the filename based on the input one.  For
	all this to work update the NeuralNetwork class with the public API
	of eval() (consistent with Neuron and Layer) as a synonym to the
	private runNNet()). Additionally, make setInputs() public to be
	accessible from outside the package.  Add test and debug targets
	with all options for the application to test on all .xml files with
	and without the --debug option. Update README with the new option
	information and the list of files.

	* TestNN.java: Clean up code more WRT coding conventions and remove
	redundant casts reported by Eclipse.

2006-01-15 15:51  mokhov

	* Makefile: Consistently space out copyright years.

2006-01-14 19:10  mokhov

	* Makefile: Most notably, enable assertions.

2006-01-03 02:53  mokhov

	* Makefile: Perform first round of copyright year updates to bump
	to 2006.

2005-12-24 17:38  mokhov

	* Makefile: Update Makefiles for most apps (SpeakerIdentApp will be
	handled separately) to produce .bz2 releases and .md5 checksums in
	the distro directory. Fix the build to TestFFT that somehow
	remained broken from the last Build System update. Clean away extra
	blank line from Regression.java.

2005-12-02 06:43  mokhov

	* TestNN.java: Clean up TestNN's code a bit and make it more
	compliant to our coding conventions as we are about to release it.

2005-11-29 20:24  mokhov

	* Makefile, README, manifest.mf: Adjust the build and packaging
	process for the NLP and TestNN apps.  Make Makefiles build the
	standard distros of -bin, -src, and -bundle for all. Make them
	build the executable jars as well. Add corresponding manifests and
	README file. Some more touch-ups and I guess a -devel release of
	these can be made before the 0.3.0 final goes out.

2005-04-23 19:31  mokhov

	* TestNN.java: Remove redundant imports. Wrap the entire code into
	one try/catch block.  Use SineLoader for artificial sample loading
	since MARF now supports that and remove own hardcoded thing to do
	the same.

2005-04-23 16:43  mokhov

	* .classpath, .project: Add Eclipse's project files to our apps.
	They are all set dependent on the MARF project.

2005-03-29 23:43  mokhov

	* Makefile: Make Makefile slightly more useful in terms of setting
	CLASSPATH and compiling and running the app.

2003-01-12 10:43  mokhov

	* samples/nnetgen.pl: Most notable is slightly sorted output for
	stats, which is sorta guaranteed to hold regardlless the way the
	stats stored in the Hashtable. The rest is cosmteic and there's
	also an attempt to streamline NNet, but not yet :-(.  I'm not sure,
	but most probably after that I won't do much for awhile -- new
	term, new worries...

2003-01-10 02:26  mokhov

	* Makefile, TestNN.java: Build System for all the apps: Global
	makefile in the apps module (/apps dir)  - Fixed all the sub
	makefiles  - Made Test apps to compile again, but JUST compile, I
	didn't test them Our main app - SpeakerIdentApp has a new option
	--version that displays app's version as well as MARF's. There is
	also version check in place to make sure the app is not being run
	against old API ( < 0.2.0 )
	
	As of this commit MARF's and SpeakerIdentApp's versions are the
	same, 0.2.0 but may diverge.

2002-12-12 14:46  mokhov

	* TestNN.java: ArtificialSample's gone

2002-11-25 02:41  mokhov

	* Makefile, TestNN.java, nn.xml, samples/nnetgen.pl,
	samples/test1.xml, samples/test2.xml, samples/test3.xml: - okay NN
	was made to work with MARF - this TestNN is a modif. of Ian's
	Driver from resources	modifs include - some stuff not found in
	rhe nnet   in MARF (some missing methods) were simply commented -
	params for training are passed via ModuleParams object It seems to
	work evem though I didn't really istimate correctness.
