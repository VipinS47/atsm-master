This project demonstrates mashup from different services and converging the results into one.

In the services tab add a new server instance e.g. `GlassFish_Server`.
It can be downloaded on the go from within the IDE.

After adding a server instance of your desire you need to import `MashupTest` into `OpenESB` using the `Import >> EclipseProject >> Import Project ingnoring Project Dependencies` and then you can reconfigure to choose one of the server instances if required.

Once the project is deployed, run it on `http://localhost:8080/WEB-INF/test-src.html`

Press `F12` to bring up the browser console and you will see the output depicting urlfeeds from different urls into one mashup.
